The home also has a 300-foot recorded view easement over the neighbor's property. The 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath residence offers a big  open floor plan, a newly created custom kitchen with top-of-line granite counters & back splash; custom cabinetry with custom white bronze handles; baking center; top of the line Thermador appliances including full size refrigerator, freezer and a lighted wine refrigerator. The full stone fireplace was hand selected from the Salmon River. It is 2 sided and is the local focal point of the living place. A local artist used hand pressed tin from a 1898 press and then created angle iron to frame. Oversized bolts & a hand created fire screen adds to the stunning look. The Master Bath was just remodeled and offers beautiful tile, walk-in shower and a large sitting tub. The open loft with 1/2 bath is perfect to use as an office or workout/ bunk room.

House is the second on the right."	"Welcome to your cabin in the woods! This 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house has been redone top to bottom and is located in a quiet neighborhood that is walking distance to shops, restaurants & downtown. New appliances, trim, doors, interior paint, countertops, bathroom vanities, tile showers & new carpet. Newer LVP flooring.  At 1700 sq ft this home is the perfect size for mountain living and there's no work to be done, just sit back and enjoy. The large front deck and covered back porch give you plenty of additional living space to enjoy the outdoors where you are surrounded by the peaceful pines and gracefully shivering aspens.  There's a large one car garage for parking as well. Kick back and relax after a day at the slopes, on the trail, at the lake or on the links. Make this your Central Idaho basecamp. State land borders the subdivision and is accessible just around the corner. "	"Roof paint is peeling but it's just cosmetic...there are no leaks of any kind and the metal is fine. Garage roof is newer. Listing added as a comp. Was about to go into the MLS but I had a ready buyer who made an acceptable offer prior to listing. "	""	"740000"	"6/26/2024"	"17"	"RR"
